- Started with vue-cli
  - works
  - generates a lot of noise compared to cra
    - all this webpack stuff
- Airbnb integration kinda sucks/quite unusual
  - Linter integration works well
  - Bytes with preetier
    - might go with that
    - WIP: https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli/issues/498
- Vue bootstrap integration
  - works
  - Little work needed that it looks like react version
- Definiton of props kinda verbose
  - miss proptypes
  - Flow/Typescript?
- computed properties remind me of knockout
- Port works
- Go with single file components,
  - mixing concerns in one file
  - reflected in different syntax
  - imports in the script tag below
  - some magic going on there
- ditch router for now
- ghpages integration not out of the box
- vetur for vscode jsut works
- go started pretty quick
  - From zero to teams in say < 2 hours
- contenteditable needs more work ...
   - roll your own? https://blog.midkemia.fr/vue-js-and-editable-contents/
- DND was rather straightforward
- Localstorage was more tricky
  - No out of the box solution
  - went with https://blog.midkemia.fr/vue-js-and-editable-contents/
  - Editing was easy, but propagating changes upward, so that localstorage was informaed was not
  - I had to learn the concept of child/parent communication
  - In Vue an $emit just fires an event to be consumed by the direct parent
    - You have to refire your event there, I didn't expect that
    - The react way of using a callback via props works as well, but does not seem to be the idiomatic way of doing things in vue
    - Nice about this is I can fire the event very close to the occurence of the contentedited event, and then can enrich the event on its way upward: Here at info about the team which name was edited. The Team component only knows about its name.
    I initially assumed, that changing the name alone is sufficient, that it is propagated to the LeagueTable, as it is bound. That assumption was wrong.
    This solutiom now feels better than expected. A thing that bothers me now, that LeagueTable knows pretty much. It is okay for me that it handles the list of teams, that's what it was made for. But handling LocalStorage should not be a concern of the LeagueTable. What do you think? A solution would be to pull the leagueTable Data one level upward to App, so I could handle LS there, but that would render the LeagueTable component to a rather passThrough component. Hmmm.
    Vuex might be a solution here. I think of a LocalStorage middleware that just does this thing for me. I think I would not need eventing then. as well. Might check that out.
- Airbnbs linter rules seem odd to me
  - dangling commas seem odd to me
  - import order seems odd to me
  - but large parts are due to my inability to configure VSCode properly to work with local eslint rules
    - It just got mangled my formatting on every autoformat, as I somewhere configured Prettier to be my formatter
      - Which I like
    - Need to spend some time there.
    - I think this happens due to to Vetur, which does not seem to read the Airbnb settings which are in the project
      - Weird, seems to me like a rabbit hole which I don't want to go down right now. Formatting and fixing on the commandline work fine

- Tests with https://github.com/vuejs/vue-test-utils-jest-example
  - Setup was okay
  - Needs some fiddling, as Jest needs to know how to deal with VUE Files. This has a little smell.
  - Feels like a duplicate of enzyme
    - where's debug()
    - why is it propsData not props
      - Why are the docs not sync+
        - https://vue-test-utils.vuejs.org/en/api/shallow.html
        - https://github.com/vuejs/vue-test-utils-jest-example/blob/master/test/Message.spec.js#L8

- Deployment
  - To GHPages
  - First try with https://github.com/jeneser/vue-cli-ghpages led to empty page, probably some / too much somewhere
    - Global install of CLI, strange
  - Second try with https://github.com/KieferSivitz/vue-gh-pages
    - Looked better, no global tool
    - Deployment section
    - First push didn't work, same error as above
      - This one does'nt use GHPages branch but docs folder
        - need to change that in settings
        - seems no to be that esoteric, there really is this option
      - Next yarn deploy it works
         - Nice!
     - This handling with deployment files seems odd as well
        - Merge conflict!

 - Tests
   - Props structure less than perfect
     - Object Prop Validation
        -  How to validate name present in Positon
     - In other news: Do I need position?
     - Testing is rather straightforward
     - vue-test-utils works as enzyme
     - Needed to mock localstorage
     - Needed to 'use' localstorage and bootstrap in test mode
       - maybe not needed all the time
     - Wrote one mounting test in League Table, to "see" the app fully rendered
TODO:
  - VSCode working nicer with eslint-airbnb
    - Or Setup Prettier with vue-cli
  - Some beautification
    - Dragging shows some nasty white edges
  - More Tests
    - Maybe DND testing
    - But I think will be quite cumbersome, without learnings about vue. Later ...
